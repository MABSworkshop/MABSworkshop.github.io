MABS 2023 is part of the AAMAS 2023 conference taking place at [ExCel London](https://www.excel.london/){:target="_blank"} in London, UK on May 30, 2023.

The meeting of researchers from Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) engineering, simulation, and the social, economic, and organizational sciences is extensively recognised for its role in cross-fertilization. The synergy among researchers from these fields has undoubtedly been an important source of inspiration for the body of knowledge that has been produced in the area.

The MABS workshop series continues with its goal to bring together researchers interested in MAS engineering and simulation, with researchers focused on understanding and finding efficient solutions to model complex social and socio-technical systems, in areas such as economics, management, organizational and social sciences in general.

In all these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, conducting exploration and testing of hypotheses, investigating better designs and systems.

We welcome paper submissions from all areas of multi-agent-based simulation and particularly also of work in early stages, which can benefit from active discussions!

## Relevant topics
The range of technical issues that MABS has dealt with, and continues to deal with, is quite diverse and extensive. Topics relevant to this workshop include, but are not limited to: 

* Simulation methodologies and tools
  + Standards for MABS
  + Methodologies and modeling formalism for MABS
  + Methodologies to combine MABS with other modeling approaches
  + Simulation languages, platforms and tools for MABS
  + Large-scale and distributed MABS
  + Scalability and robustness in MABS
  + Future challenges in MABS
* Simulation of Social and Intelligent behavior
  + Formal and agent models of social behavior
  + Cognitive modeling and simulation
  + Game theory and simulation
  + Social structure, social networks and simulating organizations
  + Simulating social complexity (e.g. structures and norms, social order, emergence of cooperation and coordinated action, self-organization, the micro-macro link)
* Applications and Empirical Work
  + MABS for socio-ecological systems
  + MABS for socio-technical systems
  + Agent-based experimental economics
  + Participatory and Human-in-the-Loop simulation
  + MABS and games
  + MABS and cloud computing
  + MABS in governance and policy-making
* Simulation Analytics
  + Visualization and analytic tools for MABS
  + Experimental design for MABS
  + Statistical and data analysis methods for MABS
  + Data mining and machine learning methods for MABS

MABS is a powerful tool that is being used to inform policy or decisions in many fields of practical importance. The use of models in general, and MABS in particular, during the COVID-19 pandemic has evidenced some of their pitfalls to inform intervention policies. Thus, we propose for 2023 to prioritize submissions of papers that explore how to tackle the pitfalls in using MABS to inform policy making.

One of the ten areas of interest in the main conference in 2023 is _Modelling and Simulation of Societies_. This aligns closely with this workshop, yet the purpose of the workshop is to foment more active discussions, particularly of work which may still be in early stages and not ready for presentation in the main conference. The MABS workshop has run alongside the main conference since AAMAS was first held in Bologna in 2002 and continues to attract a diverse and enthusiastic group of participants.

## Target audience
The workshop will provide a forum for social scientists, policy-makers, and AI, MAS and simulation researchers and developers, to assess the current state of the art in the agent-based modeling and simulation of social and socio-technical systems, to identify where and discuss how existing approaches can be successfully applied, to learn about new approaches and explore future research challenges, and to exchange ideas and knowledge in an interdisciplinary environment.

The workshop will be of interest to researchers engaged in modeling and analyzing multi-agent systems, and those interested in applying agent-based simulation techniques to real-world problems. In addition, it will attract researchers committed to cross-cutting research that is complementary to more orthodox modeling approaches.

MABS intends to be a place where researchers can exchange ideas about their work and we are looking forward to the community meeting once again in person.

## Submission guidelines
Submissions are limited to 12 pages formatted according to the [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines){:target="_blank"} and must be electronically submitted before the submission deadline through the workshop conference system, which is available at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mabs2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mabs2023){:target="_blank"}

All contributions will be peer-reviewed by at least two independent PC members. The evaluation criteria of contributions will be based on originality, quality, clarity, and its relevance to the workshop.

## Publication
All accepted papers will be printed in the AAMAS workshop proceedings. In addition, following the tradition of the previous MABS workshops, we intend to publish the accepted papers, after a further reviewing process, in the [Springer Multi-Agent-Based Simulation book series, LNAI](https://link.springer.com/conference/mabs){:target="_blank"}.
