<p>The Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS) workshop is the twentieth of a <a href="http://www.pcs.usp.br/~mabs/">series that began in
1998</a>. Its scientific focus lies in the confluence of social sciences and multi-agent
systems, with a strong application/empirical vein, and its emphasis is stressed on (i) exploratory agent based
simulation as a principled way of undertaking scientific research in the social sciences and (ii) using social
theories as an inspiration to new frameworks and developments in multi-agent systems.

<p>
The excellent quality level of this workshop has been recognized since its inception and its proceedings have
been regularly published in Springer's Lecture Notes series. MABS 2020 will be hosted at <a href="https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/">AAMAS 2020, the 19th International
Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems</a>, which will take place in Auckland, New Zealand, on May 9th-13th, 2020.
