The 2026 Multi-Agent-Based Simulation (MABS) workshop is the 27th of the [MABS series](http://www.pcs.usp.br/~mabs/), which began in 1998. Its scientific focus lies in the confluence of social sciences and multi-agent systems, with a strong application/empirical vein, and it emphasizes, (i) exploratory agent-based simulation as a principled way of undertaking scientific research in the social sciences and (ii) using social theories as an inspiration for new frameworks and developments in multi-agent systems.

The excellent quality level of this workshop has been recognized since its inception and its proceedings have been regularly published in Springer's Lecture Notes series. MABS 2026 will be hosted at [AAMAS 2026 (25th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems)](https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/), which will take place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 25th to 29rd, 2026. The MABS workshop will be held on May 26, 2026.

MABS 2026 continues its tradition of fostering cross-fertilisation and innovation in MAS engineering and complex social and sociotechnical systems modeling. The workshop encourages submissions in areas such as simulation methodology and tools, simulation of social and intelligent behaviour, diverse applications, and simulation analytics. See the detailed call for papers from the link above.
