## Preliminary Program - Monday May 19th 2025

Please note - Workshop presenters can plug-in their laptops to the projector in the conference rooms OR they can bring a USB and transfer their files to the computer in the room (and this would be a good back up plan also). If you would like to send your presentation ahead of time, please email it to mabs2025workshop@gmail.com
